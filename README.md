# v1.sladewatkins.com Archive
**This repository is the publicly archived version of the sladewatkins.com v1 release.**  

v1 was a really big release for me... it was the first site I built upon Bootstrap, which was pretty cool. Since then, I've upgraded to a newer release of Bootstrap and continued to build.

Going forward, when a release is retired, the brackets, semi-colons, and lines of words that make it all work will be archived right here on GitHub and no longer be maintained.

This is here as a read-only archive for historical purposes. 
I originally wasn't going to allow copies, but if you'd like to mess around with this repo, go for it. You're just not allowed to use it for commercial purposes and you **must** link back here somewhere very clearly in your repository (and your live site, if you decide to use it in a production environment.)
